/** The Label Layer will represent and manage groups of labels.  You
    can hand it a list of labels to display and it will group those
    in to associated drawables.  You want to give it a group for speed.
    Labels are currently drawn in Quartz, compiled into texture atlases
    and drawn together.  This will change in the future to use font
    textures.
 
    When you add a group of labels you will get back a unique ID
    which can be used to modify or delete all those labels at once.
 
    The label display can be controlled via the individual SingleLabel
    objects as well as overall look and feel with the label description
    dictionary.  That dictionary can contain the following:
 
    <list type="bullet">
    <item>enable          [NSNumber bool]
    <item>drawOffset      [NSNumber int]
    <item>drawPriority    [NSNumber int]
    <item>label           [NSString]
    <item>textColor       [UIColor]
    <item>backgroundColor [UIColor]
    <item>font            [UIFont]
    <item>width           [NSNumber float]  [In display coordinates, not geo]
    <item>height          [NSNumber float]
    <item>minVis          [NSNumber float]
    <item>maxVis          [NSNumber float]
    <item>justify         [NSString>] middle, left, right
    <item>fade            [NSSTring float]
    <item>screen          [NSNumber bool]  [If true, this is a 2D object, width and height are in screen coordinates]
    <item>layout          [NSNumber bool]  [If true, pass this off to the layout engine to compete with other labels]
    <item>layoutImportance [NSNumber float]  [If set and layout is on, this is the importance value used in competition in the layout layer]
    <item>shadowSize      [NSNumber float]  [If set, we'll draw a background shadow underneath the text of this width]
    <item>shadowColor     [UIcolor]  [If shadow size is non-zero, this will be the color we draw the shadow in.  Defaults to black.]
