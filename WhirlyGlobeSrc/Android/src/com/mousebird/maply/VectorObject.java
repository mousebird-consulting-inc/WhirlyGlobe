/**
 * The Maply VectorObject represents a group of vector features.  There can be a single point in here,
 * multiple points, or even a combination of points, areals, and linears.
 * <p>
 * You can create these yourself, but they are typically read from data files, such as GeoJSON or
 * Shapefiles.
 * <p>
 * The VectorObject is meant to be somewhat opaque (but not as opaque as originally planned).  If you
 * need to do a lot of manipulation of your vector data, it's best ot do it elsewhere and then convert
 * to a VectorObject.
