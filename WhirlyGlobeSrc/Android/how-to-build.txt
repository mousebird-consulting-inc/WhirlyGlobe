Build instructions
=====================

1) Download and install Android SDK: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html#Other

2) Download and install NDK: https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/

3) Create "local.properties" next to "build.gradle" with both SDK and NSK paths:
	sdk.dir=/Absolute/path/to/Android/SDK/root
	ndk.dir=/Absolute/path/to/Android/NDK/root

4) Run gradle to build both native and Java code. This produces AAR files at build/outputs/aar directory
	./gradlew assemble


If you want to include Maply component in your app, just include the following dependency

	dependencies {
		...
	    compile 'com.mousebirdconsulting.maply:Android:3.0.0@aar'
	}


Maply artifacts are deployed both to JCenter and Bintray (https://dl.bintray.com/mousebirdconsulting/WhirlyGlobe/) so make sure you have your repositories configured in gradle:

	repositories {
		jcenter()
	}
    
optionally...
    
	repositories {
		maven {
        	url https://dl.bintray.com/mousebirdconsulting/WhirlyGlobe/
        }
		jcenter()
	}

Thoubleshooting
=============

- After first download, Maven artifacts are cached locally. To clean them and make sure a fresh library is downloaded run the following

	find MAVEN_LOCAL_REPO | grep mouse | xargs rm -rf
	
Possible locations of your maven local repo:
	- ~/.gradle/caches -> gradle local repo
	- ~/.m2/repository -> maven2 local repo
	- ANDROID_SDK/extras/android/m2repository -> SDK's local repo
