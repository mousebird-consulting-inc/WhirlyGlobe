*** Copy your local OSM tiles here ***

File organization should be z/x/y.[jpg|png].
You can download some tiles from http://www.flightassistant.org/assets/local_osm_tiles.zip .
You should center your map on lat = 43.685278, lon = 3.928889 when using these tiles as they only cover a very small area.
They will not be pushed to Git.
