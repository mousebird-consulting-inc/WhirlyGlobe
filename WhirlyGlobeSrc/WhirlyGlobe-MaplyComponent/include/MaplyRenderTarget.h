/** @brief Represents a render target (other than the screen)
    @details Individual objects can ask to be drawn somewhere other than the screen.
    This is how we do that.
    @details A render target is just a link between a render every frame and a MaplyTexture.  To get at the actual image you use the MaplyTexture.
    @details At the moment a render target can only draw the full screen, possibly at a lower resolution.
