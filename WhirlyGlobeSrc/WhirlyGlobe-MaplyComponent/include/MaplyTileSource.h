    @brief This represents the indentifier for a unique tile in the pyramid.
    @details Each tile in an image (or vector tile) pyramid can be uniquely
    identified by an x, y, and level.  The levels start at zero and run to
    a maximum.  x and y also start at zero and run to 2^level-1.
 
    @details How these are interpreted is up to the tile source itself.  For example, some tile sources start at the lower left for (0,0) and run to the upper left.  Others do it the opposite way.  There's a flipY option in the MaplyQuadImageTileLayer to deal with this, but the system doesn't care all that much as long as you are consistent.

    @details Fill out this protocol and you can pass in your own data tile by tile. This protocol is used by the MaplyQuadImageTilesLayer to pull in image data per tile.  This can be one or more images, they can be local, remote or even generated on the fly.  It's up to the object itself to return suitable data as requested or indicate failure (by returning nil).
    @details The tile source should know its coordinate system, which is handed to Maply separately.

    @details If you fail to load the image, just return nil.  At that point the paging won't page in tiles below this image, assuming that image pyramid is truncated at that point.
    @details If you don't have an image to load (because there isn't one) and you want the layer to keep paging below that, you should pass in a MaplyPlaceholderTile.  The visual tile will be blank, but you'll have the opportunity to provide higher resolution tiles.
