/** @brief Used to represent the view controller resources attached to one or more visual objects.
    @details When you add one or more objects to a view controller, you'll get a component object back. It's an opaque object (seriously, don't look inside) that we use to track various resources within the toolkit.
    @details You can keep these around to remove the visual objects you added earlier, but that's about all the interaction you'll have with them.
