/** @brief MapBox Tiles format tile source object.
    @details This is the MBTiles format tile source.
    It'll read local MBTiles archives (https://github.com/mapbox/mbtiles-spec?source=c) which are basically just collections of image
    tiles in a sqlite database.
    @details The sqlite file must be local, that is contained
     within the bundle or copied into it at some point.  To
     access remote tile sources look at the MaplyRemoteTileSource.
    @details MBtiles archives tell us how big they are, including
     min and max zoom levels.  You can also limit the max zoom by setting
     it directly.
