/** @brief Coordinate system for tiling systems and data sources and such.
    @details This object represents the spatial reference system and bounding box for objects like the MaplyTileSource or vectors or other things.  Not all data is in lat/lon geographic (actually MaplyPlateCaree) nor is it always in MaplySphericalMercator.  Sometimes it's in one or the other, or a bit of both.
    @details We use this base class to express the coordinate system and we threw in the bounding box, which we will surely come to regret.  Oh well, it's in there.
    @details This object gets passed around to tell us what coordinate system data is in or how we're displaying things.  Right now only MaplySphericalMercator and MaplyPlateCarree are represented.  In the future, there will be more.

    @details The drawback with Spherical Mercator is that it doesn't cover the poles and it distorts (and how) its north and south extents.  Web Standard refers to the extents you'll find in most online maps.  This is probably want you want.
