 |kMaplyFilled|NSNumber boolean|If set, the areal geometry will be tesselated, taking holes into account.  The resulting triangles will be displayed instead of the vectors.|
 |kMaplySubdivType|NSString|When present, this requests that the geometry be broken up to follow the globe (really only makes sense there).  It can be set to kMaplySubdivGreatCircle or kMaplySubdivSimple which do a great circle subdivision and a simple 3-space subdivision respectively.  If the key is missing, we do no subdivision at all.|
 |kMaplySubdivEpsilon|NSNumber|If there's a kMaplySubdivType set this is the epsilon we'll pass into the subdivision routine.  The value is in display coordinates. 0.01 is a reasonable value.  Smaller results in more subdivision.|
 |kMaplyVecTexture|UIImage|If set and the kMaplyFilled attribute is set, we will apply the given texture across any areal features.  How the texture is applied can be controlled by kMaplyVecTexScaleX, kMaplyVecTexScaleY, kMaplyVecCenterX, kMaplyVecCenterY, and kMaplyVecTextureProjection|
 |kMaplyVecTexScaleX,kMaplyVecTexScaleY|NSNumber|These control the scale of the texture application.  We'll multiply by these numbers before generating texture coordinates from the vertices.|
 |kMaplyVecCenterX,kMaplyVecCenterY|NSNumber|These control the center of a texture application.  If not set we'll use the areal's centroid.  If set, we'll use these instead.  They should be in local coordinates (probably geographic radians).|
 |kMaplyVecTextureProjection|NSString|This controls how a texture is projected onto an areal feature.  By default we just use the geographic coordinates and stretch them out.  This look odd for very large features.  If you set this to kMaplyProjectionTangentPlane then we'll take the center of the feature, make a tangent plane and then project the coordinates onto that tangent plane to get texture coordinates.  This looks nice at the poles.|

 |kMaplyZBufferWrite|NSNumber boolean|If set this geometry will write to the z buffer.  That means following geometry that reads the z buffer will be occluded.  This is off by default.|
 |kMaplyEnable|NSNumber boolean|On by default, but if off then the feature exists, but is not turned on.  It can be enabled with enableObjects:|
