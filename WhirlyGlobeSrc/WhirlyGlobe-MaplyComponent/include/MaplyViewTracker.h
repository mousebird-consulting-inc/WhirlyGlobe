/** @brief The View Tracker associates a view with a geographic location.
    @details The Maply View Tracker will move a UIView around to keep track of a geographic location.  This is basically used for popups.  The system will move the view around at the end of the frame render.  It will hide the UIView if needed or make it reappear.  The UIView should be a child of view controller's view.
