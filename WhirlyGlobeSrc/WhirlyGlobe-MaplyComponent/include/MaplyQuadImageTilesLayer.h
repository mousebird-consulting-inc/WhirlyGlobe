/** @brief The Maply Quad Image Tiles Layer is for paging image pyramids local or remote.
    @details This layer pages image pyramids.  They can be local or remote, in any coordinate system Maply supports and you provide a MaplyTileSource conformant object to do the actual image tile fetching.
    @details This is the main interface for image pyramid paging and so has a lot of knobs you can twiddle.  The defaults should work fine in most cases.
    @details You probably don't have to implement your own tile source.  Go look at the MaplyRemoteTileSource and MaplyMBTileSource objects, as well as MaplyMultiplexTileSource.  Those will do remote, local, and sources for animation respectively.  There's also MaplyWMSTileSource, but I wouldn't expect to use that.

    @param coordSys The coordinate system. This must match what your
            image pyramid is in, or it will look weird.  Very weird.

    @details This option makes zero sense in 2D mode, some sense if 3D map mode (if you're doing elevation) and a lot of sense in globe mode.  What it does is generate skirts along the sides of each tile so you can't see between that tile and the next one when it abuts a different level of detail.
    @details Best to set this explicitly.  For a base map (e.g. the first image layer you put down), it should probably be set.  For following layers it should probably not, but specifics can change.  Try it out.

    @details This is for spherical mercator with web extents.  That projection doesn't run all the way to the poles, but it gets fairly close.  If set, we close that gap for the north and south poles and generate the remaining geometry.
    @details We'll pull a texture value from the edge of the images, so build your texture accordingly.  A nice flat color along the north and south border is the best idea.  If not, it'll look a little odd, but still okay.
    @details Though this is designed for MaplySphericalMercator, it may work in similar projections.  It's not going to make any sense for, say UTM, but give it a try.

    @details What this does is prevent flat tiles from showing up if there's more imagery than elevation.

    @details Tile loading can get out of control when using elevation data.  The toolkit calculates potential sceen coverage for each tile so elevation data makes all tiles more important.  As a result the system will happily page in way more data than you may want.  The limit becomes important in elevation mode, so leave it at 128 unless you need to change it.

    @details This option controls the size of those texture atlases.  It's set to 2048 by default (2048x2048 texels).  If you're going to change it, set it to 1024, but don't go any lower unless you know something we don't.  It must always be a power of 2.

/** @brief Set the image format for the texture atlases (thus the imagery).
    @details OpenGL ES offers us several image formats that are more efficient than 32 bit RGBA, but they're not always appropriate.  This property lets you choose one of them.  The 16 or 8 bit ones can save a huge amount of space and will work well for some imagery, most maps, and a lot of weather overlays.
    @details Be sure to set this at layer creation, it won't do anything later on.

| MaplyImageUShort4444 | 16 bits with 4 bits for each channel. |
| MaplyImageUShort5551 | 16 bits with 5/5/5 bits for RGB and 1 bit for A. |

| MaplyImageUByteAlpha | 8 bits, where we choose the A and ignore the rest. |
| MaplyImageUByteRGB | 8 bits, where we average RGB for the value. |
