/** @brief An elevation source corresponding to a custom sqlite database.
    @details The Maply Elevation Database object interfaces to a custom sqlite
    database that contains elevation tiles.  This is the output of the
    elev_tile_pyramid command line tool.  See that for details.
    Suffice it to say that each tile is separate, contains one extra
    cell on the northern and eastern sides and is made up for shorts (16 bit).
