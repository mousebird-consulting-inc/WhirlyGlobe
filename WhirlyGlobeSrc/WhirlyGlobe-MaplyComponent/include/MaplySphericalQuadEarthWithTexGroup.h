/** @brief Spherical quad earth layer is an older style of base map
    @details The Spherical quad earth layer fires up an older style of image map generated by the ImageChopper program.  It can be either an image pyramid or a flat grid of images.  In general, we recommend using the MaplyQuadImageTilesLayer instead.

    @details This initializer wants the name of a texture group file as created by the ImageChopper program.  That's a plist and a group of images to go with it.
    @details Seriously, go use MaplyQuadImageTilesLayer instead.
