What is WhirlyGlobe-Maply?
---

The WhirlyGlobe part is a self contained 3D earth display component suitable for use in iPhone and iPad apps. The globe is rendered in OpenGL ES with a pageable quad tree texture and support for vector data overlays. It is intended as a (relatively) lightweight widget that can be dropped in to your app to do simple data overlay and interaction with a globe. It can also do more heavy duty data interaction if you want to use it as the centerpiece for a globe based app.

The Maply part displays exactly the same data in much the same way except as a flat map (with or without perspective).  It's the same toolkit, with different entry points (view controllers, basically).  You get both in the WhirlyGlobe-Maply distribution.

This is the master branch of the WhirlyGlobe-Maply Component and API version 2.2.  It should be easy to compile, as all the crazy dependencies are in submodules.  You can also get a precompiled version.  Check the project page for that.

WhirlyGlobe-Maply uses a bunch of submodules, which you'll need to get.  Like so.

git submodule init
git submodule update

Get comfortable.  The data is contained in a submodule and it's large.

Once you get all this synced, try to build WhirlyGlobeComponentTester.  If it builds, you're good to go.  Enjoy.
