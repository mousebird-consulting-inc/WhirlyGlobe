What is WhirlyGlobe-Maply?
---

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is a mapping toolkit with two parts, hence the dash. The WhirlyGlobe part is an interactive 3D globe. The Maply part is an interactive 2D map. There are separate view controllers (on iOS) for each, but otherwise they share 95% of their code.

This toolkit is used in [many apps](http://mousebird-consulting-inc.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/apps/apps.html) from big, complicated apps to even more smaller, simpler apps. Feel free to use it in yours.

WhirlyGlobe-Maply is available for both iOS and Android.

This is the main branch of the WhirlyGlobe-Maply Component and API version 3.4. It should be easy to compile, as all the crazy dependencies are in submodules. You can also get a [precompiled version](https://mousebird-consulting-inc.github.io/WhirlyGlobe/builds/builds.html).

WhirlyGlobe-Maply uses a bunch of submodules, which you'll need to get. Like so:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Get comfortable. The data is contained in a submodule and it's large.

Once you get all this synced, try to build AutoTester. If it builds, you're good to go. Enjoy.
