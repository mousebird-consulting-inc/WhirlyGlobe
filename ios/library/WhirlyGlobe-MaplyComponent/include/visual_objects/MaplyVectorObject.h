/** 
    Maply Vector Object represents zero or more vector features.
    
    The Vector Object can hold several vector features of the same or different types.  It's meant to be a fairly opaque structure, often read from GeoJSON or Shapefiles.  It's less opaque than originally planned, however, and sports a number of specific methods.
    
    If you're doing real vector manipulation, it's best to do it somewhere else and then create one of these as needed for display.
    
    Vector Objects can be created directly or read from a MaplyVectorDatabase.  They are typically then displayed on top of a MaplyViewController or WhirlyGlobeViewController as vectors.
    
    Vector Objects vertices are always in geographic, with longitude = x and latitude = y.
