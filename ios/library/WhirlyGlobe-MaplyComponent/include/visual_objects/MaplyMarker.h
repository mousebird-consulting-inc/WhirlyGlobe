/** 
    The Marker places a UIImage on the globe or map at a given location.
    
    The Maply Marker takes a location and image, using those to display a textured rectangle on the globe (or map).  Since it's a real 3D object it will get larger and smaller as the user moves around.
    
    If you want a screen based object that stays the same size and is displayed on top of everything else, look to the MaplyScreenMarker.
