/** 
    The Screen Marker is a 2D object that displays an image on the screen tracking a given location.
    
    The screen marker will track the given geographic location and display a centered rectangle with the given image.  Essentially it's a free floating icon, similar to the MaplyScreenLabel and it will always be drawn on top of other objects.  If the location would be behind the globe (in globe mode), the marker will disappear.
    
    If you're looking for a 3D marker object, that's the MaplyMarker.
