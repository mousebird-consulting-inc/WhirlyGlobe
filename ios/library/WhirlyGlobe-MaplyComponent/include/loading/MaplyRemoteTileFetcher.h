 Remote Tile Info Object (New)

 the new remote tile info object contains min/max zoom, coordinate system and URL
 information for fetching individual data tiles.

 Initialize with enough information to fetch remote tiles.

 @param minZoom The minimum zoom level to fetch.  This really should be 0.
 
 @param maxZoom The maximum zoom level to fetch.
 
 @return The MaplyRemoteTileInfoNew object or nil on failure.
