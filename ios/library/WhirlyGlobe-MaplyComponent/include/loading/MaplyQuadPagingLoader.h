/** General purpose quad paging loader.
 
    This quadtree based paging loader is for fetching and load general geometry.
    There are other loaders that handle images and image animations.  This one is
    purely for geometry.
 
    You need to fill in at least a MaplyLoaderInterpreter, which is probably your own
    implementation.
 
    This replaces the QuadPagingLayer from WhirlyGlobe-Maply 2.x.
