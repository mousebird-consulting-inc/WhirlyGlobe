    The geometry builder is used to construct 3D models.
    
    You use the geometry builder when you have a custom 3D model to build.  This can include things like airport runways, buildings, or anything else that's particular to a certain location.
    
    Start by construting the builder and then adding polygons and strings to it.
    
    You can combine multiple geometry builders together to build up repeated portions of a model.
    
    The builder has an "immediate mode" where you add points individually to build up polygons and then add those.  This is one of the simpler ways to use the system.
