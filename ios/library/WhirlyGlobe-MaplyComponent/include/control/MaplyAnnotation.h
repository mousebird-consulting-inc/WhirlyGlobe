/** 
    This object displays an annotation at a particular point and will track that point as the map or globe moves.
    
    An annotation is used to point out some feature on the globe or map, typically that the user has tapped on.  It's a multi-part beast that may contain titles, subtitles, images, background views and such.
    
    To add one, create the MaplyAnnotation and then call addAnnotation:forPoint:offset: on the MaplyBaseViewController.
    
    The MaplyAnnotation is a wrapper around the SMCalloutView by Nick Farina.  It exposes much of the functionality, but sets things up correctly and deals with moving the annotation around.
